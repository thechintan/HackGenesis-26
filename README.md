# CoastalEye AI - Coastal Threat Alert System 🌊🚨

A real-time disaster prevention platform designed to protect lives and properties in coastal regions. The system leverages IoT sensors and satellite datasets to continuously monitor environmental conditions, feeding data into trained machine learning models that detect risk patterns based on historical disaster records — enabling early warnings before a threat escalates.

It is also a comprehensive disaster management and coastal monitoring platform designed to provide real-time alerts, community reporting, and authority response coordination. It empowers coastal communities and authorities to stay ahead of natural threats like cyclones, floods, and tsunamis.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🌍 For the Community (Public Interface)
- **Live Threat Map**: Interactive map visualizing real-time wind, weather, and potential risk zones.
- **Satellite & IoT Data Integration**: Aggregates real-time sensor data from **Open-Meteo** (Satellite Weather) and **USGS** (Seismic IoT Sensors) to detect cyclones and tsunamis instantly.
- **Community Sentinel**: A social feed for users to report local hazards (with image uploads and geolocation).
- **Humanitarian Aid Hub**: Request emergency assistance (Medical, Food, Evacuation) with urgency levels.
- **Risk Trends**: Visual analytics of flood, storm, and tsunami risks over time.
- **My Activity Log**: Track the status of your reported posts and aid requests.

### 🛡️ For Authorities (Dashboard)
- **Centralized Command Center**: View and manage all incoming community reports and aid requests.
- **AI-Powered Prioritization**: Auto-ranking of alerts and requests based on severity and urgency scores.
- **Dispatch & Action**: Tools to dispatch teams, notify locals, or resolve incidents directly from the dashboard.
- **Role-Based Access**: Secure login specifically for authorized personnel (Coastal Admins).

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Vanilla HTML5, CSS3 (Glassmorphism Design), JavaScript (ES6+).
- **Backend**: Python (FastAPI).
- **Database**: SQLite (managed via SQLAlchemy).
- **Real-Time Data APIs**:
    - **Open-Meteo**: Satellite-based weather and wind speed data.
    - **USGS**: IoT Seismic Sensor networks for earthquake/tsunami detection.
    - **Leaflet**: Geospatial mapping.
- **Design**: Responsive, Dark-themed UI with `Inter` and `Playfair Display` typography.

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/thechintan/HackGenesis-26.git
    cd HackGenesis-26/HackGenesis_Temporary
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**
    Ensure you have Python installed. Install the required Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install fastapi uvicorn sqlalchemy requests
    ```

3.  **Initialize the Database**
    Run the database manager to set up tables and create an admin user if needed:
    ```bash
    python manage_db.py
    # Select Option 5 (User) -> Option 5 (Create Test Admin User) to generate an admin account.
    ```
    *Default Admin Credentials:* `admin@coastal.com` / `admin123`

4.  **Run the Backend Server**
    Start the FastAPI server:
    ```bash
    python -m backend.main
    ```
    The server will start at `http://127.0.0.1:8001`.

5.  **Access the Application**
    Open `frontend.html` in your browser.
    *   **User View**: Sign up or log in to report incidents.
    *   **Authority View**: Log in with admin credentials to access the `authority_dashboard.html`.
